Virtual private servers are like home servers except the machines are owned by someone else.

The cheapest options are virtual machines with a shared CPU, with around 2GB of RAM for 5 or 6 bucks.
Digital Ocean droplet or Linode Nanode.

I think the programs that we might host on a VPS instance is:

1. Whoogle ^opt-start
2. Shiori
3. Bitwarden
