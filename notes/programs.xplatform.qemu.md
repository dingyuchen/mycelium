Qemu is an open-source emualator for operating systems.
It makes use of [[kvm|programs.xplatform.kvm]] to run virtual machines at near-native speed. (Virtualization)

## Difference between Virtualization and Emulation

Virtualization relies on the underlying machine architecture being the same.
Therefore virtualization runs much faster than emulation.
