## Why note-taking is important to me

I realise that the human brain is fallible.
There are an inordinate amount of things that require my attention in this current day and age, but I do not have the capacity to remember them all.
One very important thing is the fact that to advance my career in Software Engineering, I need to maintain a conscious effort to seek out and learn new knowledge.
Learning is a process of synthesis, recognition is insufficient.
However, it is also an uphill task to internalize concepts without committing new knowledge into memory.

Therefore, I believe that the solution is to somehow organize knowledge in text form, in some way that is future-proof, and to have mechanisms to pull up the necessary information when I need it.
I have always wanted to make lifelong notes when I came across [Jethro Kuan's Emacs workflow](https://blog.jethro.dev/posts/zettelkasten_with_org/), which led me down the rabbit hole of Zettelkastens and Personal Knowledge Management(PKM) systems.
The idea of a constant building up of knowledge and making outsized achievements was enticing.

I have tried almost every tool out there, but I've decided to settle on [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/) in the end.
This is how it came to be.

When I first came across the organization of notes as something like a wiki, notes have connections with each other rather than a linear filing, I thought that was definitely the way to go.
