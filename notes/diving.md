## Underwater Navigation

### Introduction

Effective navigation has as least 5 distinct benefits:

1. Reduces Anxiety and Confusion
2. Helps Avoid Long Surface Swims
3. Increase Dive Plan Effectiveness
4. Helps Avoid Buddy Separation
5. Conserves Gas

### Distance Estimation

#### Kick cycles
A kick cycle is the distance you cover when both of your legs complete one fin stroke.

Gauge kick cycle distance by swimming a known distance while counting the number of cycles.

Curent will afafect accuracy, though in surge they're moderately accurate if you maintain a steady pace, as the back and forth water motion tends to cancel out.

#### Elapsed Time

Gauge distance by measuring the time it takes to swim a known distance.

Swim at your normal, relaxed pace.

#### Cylinder Pressure

At the same depth and activity level, your gas consumption is realtively uniform.

### Natural Navigation

Natural navigation is navigation based on what you observe in the environment.

#### Predive Observations

Natural navigation begins before you dive, by looking at environment for navigational references.

- Water Motion
  - The direction of waves, currents and tides
- Sun Direction and Angle
- Objects and Formations

##### Depth Finder

Depth finders show you bottom contours, wreks and reeds, all of which can be references that indicate where you are during the dive.

#### Descents

Improve navigation by maintaining your orientation as you descend.

#### Natural References

Once underwater, you orient yourself through a variety of natural references. The six most common of these are light and shadows, water movement, bottom composition and formations, bottom contours, plants and animals, and sound.

#### Sun and shadows

Use shadows to mark reference.

#### Sand Ripples

Sand ripple patterns usually go parallel with the shoreline

### Compass Navigation

Features:

- Dampened response
- Indicates direction even when not perfectly level
- Provide degree numbers,
- Readable with low light
- Actual or virtual lubber lines and bezels

The lubber line indicates your travel direction and the bezel helps you hold a stady heading while swimming.

#### Navigation Patterns

Forward and back
- rotate compass bezel 180% and realign to index marks

Squares and rectangles

### Deep Diving

A deep dive is a dive deeper than 18m to a maximum depth of 40m.

#### Buddy Contact

If buddies separate, they should immediately take steps to reunite.
Search no longer than a minute, then reunite at the surface.

#### Wall Dive

Upon downwelling, put air into BCD and swim directly away from the wall until free of current.
