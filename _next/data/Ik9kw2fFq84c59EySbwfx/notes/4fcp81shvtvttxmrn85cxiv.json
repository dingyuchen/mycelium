href=\"#why-note-taking-is-important-to-me\"></a></h2>\n<p>I realise that the human brain is fallible.\nThere are an inordinate amount of things that require my attention in this current day and age, but I do not have the capacity to remember them all.\nOne very important thing is the fact that to advance my career in Software Engineering, I need to maintain a conscious effort to seek out and learn new knowledge.\nLearning is a process of synthesis, recognition is insufficient.\nHowever, it is also an uphill task to internalize concepts without committing new knowledge into memory.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I believe that the solution is to somehow organize knowledge in text form, in some way that is future-proof, and to have mechanisms to pull up the necessary information when I need it.\nI have always wanted to make lifelong notes when I came across <a href=\"https://blog.jethro.dev/posts/zettelkasten_with_org/\">Jethro Kuan's Emacs workflow</a>, which led me down the rabbit hole of Zettelkastens and Personal Knowledge Management(PKM) systems.\nThe idea of a constant building up of knowledge and making outsized achievements was enticing.</p>\n<p>I have tried almost every tool out there, but I've decided to settle on <a href=\"https://www.dendron.so/\">Dendron</a> in the end.\nThis is how it came to be.</p>\n<h2

href=\"#a-comparison-of-free-unstructured-note-taking-tools-out-there\"></a></h2>\n<p>When I first came across the organization of notes as something like a wiki, notes have connections with each other rather than a linear filing, I thought that was definitely the way to go.</p>","noteIndex":{"fname":"self","stub":true,"vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"mycelium","remote":{"type":"git","url":"git@github.com:dingyuchen/mycelium.git"}},"schemaStub":false,"type":"note","updated":1670335116867,"created":1670335116867,"id":"jeno2gw2ru0lk2hjk1t6kfu","desc":"","links":[],"anchors":{},"children":["70y9r1m7w3dczky3qheeu6x","z2mx05a21tjcul6e2zpymg8","7v6qrwbbehg9qifk52eo107"],"parent":null,"body":"","data":{},"title":"Self","custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"}},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":"dependencies/localhost/workplace","selfContained":true,"name":"workplace"},{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"mycelium","remote":{"type":"git","url":"git@github.com:dingyuchen/mycelium.git"}}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":"
